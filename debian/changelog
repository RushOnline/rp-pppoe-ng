rp-pppoe (3.8-3ubuntu1) oneiric; urgency=low

  * Tweak and apply patch by Igor A Tarasov to resolve pppoe-server not
    honoring pppd's configured IP addresses. This patch adds a '-D'
    (delegate) option, similar to pptpd's, that causes pppoe-server to
    skip adding its own local and remote IP addresses to the pppd
    command line, thereby allowing pppd to perform address assignment
    properly. Thanks, Igor! (LP: #705872)

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Tue, 25 Apr 2006 20:53:50 -0400

rp-pppoe (3.5-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Added patch by Max Vozeler <max@hinterhof.net> to ignore -D and -p
    when pppoe is not running as root to prevent a potential root
    compromise by users in group dip when pppoe is running setuid root.
    [src/pppoe.c, CAN-2004-0564] Note that group dip is empty by default
    on Debian installs.

rp-pppoe (3.5-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Oops! pppoe should be installed setuid root, not setgid dip to close
  bugs 102050 and 172376! Still installed without the execute bit for other, so
  safe from a security standpoint, since group dip is empty by default.
  * Remove debian/conffiles since debconf 4 creates it.

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Tue, 16 Sep 2003 15:06:35 -0400

    which are required by the RFC. README.Debian updated.

 -- David Kimdon <dwhedon@debian.org>  Sun,  3 Feb 2002 16:44:55 -0800

rp-pppoe (3.3-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release. (Closes: #113885)
  * Default to "-m 1452" in dsl-provider. (Closes: #113300)

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Nov 2001 15:28:10 -0500

    the interface up if it wasn't up. (Closes: #106970)
  * Bugs fixed in this or a previous release: 
    closes: #94540, #83918, #70834, #72065, #80137, #86226, #79319, #75443, #67863, #79529, #88499, #91330.

rp-pppoe (3.0-4) unstable; urgency=high

  * Remove -arp switch from ppp_on_boot and pppoe wrapper. This breaks
    networks were the DSL modem is connected to a hub and not directly to
    a network interface. (Closes: #100833)

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Thu, 14 Jun 2001 13:52:42 -0400

rp-pppoe (3.0-3) unstable; urgency=low

  * Added instructions on how to set up pppoe to work with pon, for people
    that are billed by their DSL provider for minutes connected. (Which is
    somewhat odd...)
  * Wrapper around pppoe to automatically bring up the interface that will
    be used by pppoe. Needed for pon support because /etc/network/interfaces
    doesn't support bringing up an interface without assigning it an
    IP address, and pon doesn't support the execution of arbitrary
    commands before the execution of pppd. (Well, except for ppp_on_boot,
    which we don't want to use in this case.)
  * Also added instructions on how to use demand-dialing.
  * Corrected thinko in README.Debian file.

 -- Christian Hudon <chrish@debian.org>  Mon, 11 Jun 2001 15:44:47 -0400
